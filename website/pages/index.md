## 2023 June 08 - Integration and size fixing

We had a lot of issues with Unity navmesh sizing, we tried scaling everything VR by 10x, this way we can leave our tiles at units of 1 and not break the navmesh system.

Integrating with the animations is working, but their origin and size is incorrect for now. 

It also looks kind of gross at the moment.

We changed a bit the pitch and precised the story we wanted to tell while unfolding this haunted house. We decided to tell the story of a chase between a robber and the owner of the house. The two of them being a badger and an hen. Both of them end up trapped by the tricky architecture.

For the maquette, we also chose the type of paper we decided to use and printed some cutout example of a house.
